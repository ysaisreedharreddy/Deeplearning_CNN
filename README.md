CNN for Emotion Recognition: Happy vs Sad Faces
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to differentiate between happy and sad facial expressions. This project is an excellent primer for those interested in computer vision and emotion recognition using deep learning.

Project Overview
The notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of using CNNs with TensorFlow and Keras to recognize emotional expressions from facial images. The key aspects covered include:
Data Preprocessing: How to load and preprocess facial images for neural network training.
CNN Architecture: Building a CNN model that can effectively learn features from facial images to classify emotions.
Model Training and Evaluation: Techniques for training the model and evaluating its accuracy and performance.

Features
CNN Model: Detailed explanation of the CNN layers and their roles in feature extraction.
Data Augmentation: Utilizes data augmentation techniques to improve model generalizability.
Visualization: Includes visualizations of training results and intermediate CNN outputs to understand model behavior.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used.
TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training the CNN model.
NumPy: For handling numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing data.
